# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species — *Setosa, **Versicolor, and **Virginica* — using the *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* algorithm.

It is developed as part of the *DataZenix Internship Program*.

## 📁 Dataset

I used the official UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset:  
🔗 [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data)

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Data Import from UCI repository  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data Visualization (Pairplots)  
4. Preprocessing and Splitting  
5. Model Training using KNN  
6. Accuracy Evaluation  
7. Final Predictions
